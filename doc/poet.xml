<!--??? Should this be "chapter"? I think "chapter" is not allowed in an 
  article and so it should be "sect1". But "sect1" doesn't work with my
  stylesheet. Rethink this.

    This is the <command>Poet</command> program that mutilates text.
    It was inspired by an article in the 
    <emphasis>Computer-Kurzweil</emphasis>
    series in 
    <emphasis>Spektrum der Wissenschaft</emphasis>.
    A similar program is 
    <emphasis>dissociated press</emphasis>
    which is available in 
    <command>emacs</command> 
    by using the command
    <command>M-x dissociated-press</command>.

    The program has the following input: A text and an integer that 
    specifies the length of the block to be used.
    The program works a follows: Beginning with the first 
    <varname>k</varname> letters of the
    text, it looks up all successors of that block. It then randomly
    chooses one of those successors. It appends the successor to the
    output-text. Then it shifts the block, appending the successor
    and dropping the first letter. The program stops, if the end of
    the input text appears as the chosen successor.
    The result is a semi-random text that looks quite meaningful for
    bigger values of <varname>k</varname> (<varname>k</varname> bigger
    than 3.)

    This program is an example for the use of an ADT (Abstract Data Type),
    a technique that i prefer for writing C programs.
